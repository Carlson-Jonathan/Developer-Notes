Modular Code Organization Example using CMake

This example demonstrates how to organize code in a modular way using CMake. The project structure consists of multiple nested folders, each representing a different module or component of the system. The organization aims to improve code separation, reusability, and maintainability.

Project Structure:
- Top-level directory (project root): Contains the main CMakeLists.txt file and the main.cpp file.
- Subdirectory 1: Represents the first-level module and contains its own CMakeLists.txt file.
- Subdirectory 2: Represents the second-level module and contains its own CMakeLists.txt file.
- Subdirectory 3: Represents the third-level module and contains its own CMakeLists.txt file.
- Subdirectory 4: Represents the fourth-level module and contains its own CMakeLists.txt file.

The CMakeLists.txt files are used to define the build configurations, targets, and dependencies for each module. The higher-level CMakeLists.txt files include and process the CMakeLists.txt files of their respective subdirectories.

How it Works:
The main CMakeLists.txt file in the top-level directory is responsible for configuring the project and defining the main target (executable). Each subdirectory contains its own CMakeLists.txt file, defining the targets specific to that module. The CMakeLists.txt files specify the source files, libraries, include directories, and other configurations for the targets. The `add_subdirectory` command is used to include and process the CMakeLists.txt files of the subdirectories. The `target_link_libraries` command establishes dependencies between the targets, ensuring proper linking and ordering during the build process. The `target_include_directories` command is used to specify the include directories for each target, enabling proper header file inclusion. 

By organizing the code in a modular way and using CMake to manage the build process, the project becomes more maintainable, scalable, and reusable. Each module can be developed, tested, and maintained independently, and dependencies between modules are explicitly defined.
