In 08/2021 GitHub screwed up access so you can no longer use your 
GitHub web login credentials to push using Git. Instead you need
a personal access key which is generated on their website 
similar to how an SSH key-pair authentication works. To get your
key, log into your online GitHub account, then click your picture, 
click "settings", then "Developer Settings", then "Personal 
access tokens". Use this tool to generate your key. 

When you push, Git will ask you for your credentials, same as
always, except you will use your key instead of your password.

You can use the GitHub client to automatically enter your key
for you when you want to push so you dont have to go through the
hassel of copying and pasting your key every time.

Copy and paste the below to install the gh client if you don't
have it already:

curl -fsSL https://cli.github.com/packages/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/githubcli-archive-keyring.gpg] https://cli.github.com/packages stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/github-cli.list > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gh

Once installed, enter the command in the terminal to configure
your github client with your credentials:
   gh auth login

You will receive prompts that you can use the arrow keys to
select. Eventually, it will ask you if you want to paste in your
key. Do that and you should be able to push without entering 
credentials ever again. 

My current GitHub push key: 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
