Random things I learned about PostgreSQL:

* sudo service postgresql status (check server status)
* postgres port = 5432
* Port number and incomming connections can be modified in file:
	/etc/postgresql/<version number>/main/postgresql.conf

* You can tweak connection permissions (local and incomming) in file 'pg_hba.conf' (same directory)
* md5 and scram-sha-256 are encryption methods. Set to 'trust' to prevent password authentication.
* To add an incomming connection from a specific computer, add line under IPv4:
	host	all	all	<ip address>/32		<encryption type>
	
* pgAdmin4 is a GUI database admin program like PEM. Access with URL '<ip address>/pgAdmin4'
* PostgreSQL's offical C++ interface library is 'lpqxx'
	g++ postgres.cpp -lpqxx -lpq	(compile command)
	
* Connect to a remote psql server in the terminal with:
	psql -h <remote IP address> -p <port num> -d <database> -U <user name>
